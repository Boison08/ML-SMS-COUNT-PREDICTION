SMS Count Prediction Model Analysis
=====================================

1. Data Preparation and Exploration
----------------------------------
- Loaded SMS traffic dataset from 'data.csv'
- Performed initial data exploration using pandas
- Generated correlation matrix to understand feature relationships
- Visualized correlations using a heatmap
- Key features included various metrics related to SMS traffic
- Target variable: total_sms count

2. Feature Selection
-------------------
- Removed 'datetime' column as it wasn't directly useful for prediction
- Selected all remaining numeric columns as features
- Split features (X) and target variable (Y)
- Features represent various SMS traffic metrics
- Target variable represents the total SMS count we want to predict

3. Data Splitting
----------------
- Split data into training (67%) and testing (33%) sets
- Used random_state=42 for reproducibility
- Training set: Used to teach the model patterns in the data
- Testing set: Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data

4. Model Training
----------------
- Used Linear Regression model
- Trained on the training dataset
- Model learned relationships between features and target variable
- Simple but interpretable model choice

5. Model Evaluation
------------------
Training Set Performance:
- R² Score: Shows how well the model fits the training data
- Mean Absolute Error: Average magnitude of prediction errors

Testing Set Performance:
- R² Score: Indicates model's ability to generalize
- Mean Absolute Error: Shows prediction accuracy on new data

6. Visualization
---------------
- Created scatter plots of actual vs predicted values
- Added reference line for perfect predictions
- Helps visualize where model performs well or poorly
- Shows any systematic bias in predictions

Conclusion
----------
Strengths:
- Model shows reasonable predictive capability
- Linear approach provides interpretable results
- Implementation is computationally efficient

Limitations:
- Assumes linear relationships between features
- May miss complex patterns in the data
- Performance might be improved with more advanced models

Recommendations:
1. Consider trying non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
2. Feature engineering might improve performance
3. Collect more data if possible
